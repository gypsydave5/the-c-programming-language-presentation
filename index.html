        <h1>The C Programming Language</h1>
        <aside>
          Tonight I'd like to talk to you all about C, because I think that - even
          though we may never need to use this language in production (in fact it
          may be a terrible idea to use it in production), I think we can all learn
          something from learning it. Learning C helped me to understand both
          programming and my computer better.

        <h1>My Background</h1>
        <aside>So I'd like to try and give some background on why I learnt a bit of C.</aside>

          First up is this little fella - the Go Gopher. I've been learning Go in a
          dedicated way for a number of months - it's great. But I noticed that
          almost all the docs and blog posts have a sentence that starts off "In C..."
          Go comes from C - that becomes really obvious when you see them both - and
          it was written in many respects to make up for C's deficiencies.

          Next up is algorithms. Denise started a Coursera course on algorithms,
          and suggested I might like to join in. The languages they'd accept were
          Python (just like Ruby - meh), C++ (LOOKS HARD!), Java (bleaugh) and C.
          So I went with C. Denise said "C? Life on hard mode", and she was right.

        <h1>C's Background</h1>
        <aside>
          Where is C from? Well, in the early 70s Bell labs was building a new operating
          system called Unix, on a computer called a PDP-7. Two of the guys working on it
          were a pair of very clever people called Ken Thompson and Dennis Richie
        </aside>
      </section>
      <section><img src="images/thompson-richie.jpg">
        <aside>
          That's Richie on the right. The language they were using to
          program the PDP-7 was written by Thompson for another system, but it
          couldn't use all the advanced features of the computer. That language
          was called B, so Richie wrote an improved B. Which he called C.
          Because, well C comes after B. It was written to be a pretty
          high-level language which also allowed direct access to your
          computer's memory. Which made it great for writing operating systems.
          And so C is _everywhere_ - literally, your computer is running in it.
          It's in all of your computers right now. So let's get stuck in.

        <h1>"hello, world"</h1>
        <aside>Let's write a "hello, world" together</aside>
      </section>
      <section><img src="/images/c-cover.png">
        <aside>
          Fun fact: "hello, world" was popularised by this book, by Dennis Richie
          and Brian Kernighan (also of Bell Labs and Unix). It's so influential
          that people often refer to it and the style of writing code as "K&R"
        </aside>
      </section>
      <section>
        <pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
    printf("hello, world\n");
}
</code></pre>
        <aside>
          Crack open your favourite text editor and put this in. Let's save it
          as something useful like "hello-world.c". And now let's compile it. This is
          nice and easy. `gcc` is the Gnu Compiler Collection (formerly the Gnu C Compiler)
          so we write `gcc hello-world.c`. This produces an executable calle `a.out`
          So let's run that with `./a.out`. And, behold - hello world.
          Let's break that code down a little.
        </aside>
      </section>
      <section>
        <pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
</code></pre>
        <aside>
          first, the `include` thing at the top. That looks pretty weird, right?
          All it's doing is telling the c program to bring in some function definitions
          to the program you're writing. It's a bit like `require` in Ruby - but not
          quite. There are some subtleties. But here we're bringing in the header file
          `.h` - for `stdio` - functions that handle io. Like printing!
        </aside>
      </section>
      <section>
        <pre><code class="language-c">int main() {
    printf("hello, world\n");
}
</code></pre>
        <aside>
          Next is a function called main, which is special in C, as it is in Java
          and Go, in that it's what gets run when the C program is executed. The `int` bit
          tells us that it's returning an int, the parentheses are the
          arguments - we're not using any - and then the body is in the curly
          braces. So familiar, right?
          And then, `printf`, which just prints to the screen the string literal that comes
          afterwards. And we end the line with a semicolon because, well, this is C.
          Anyone tell me why the return type is an int? And guess what the default
          return type is for main?
        </aside>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h1>Types</h1>
        <aside>so I said the type is an int. What other types are there to play with in C?</aside>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>
          <ul>
            <li>char</li>
            <li>int</li>
            <li>float</li>
            <li>double</li>
            <li>long</li>

            <li>unsigned int</li>
            <li>unsigned long long</li>
          </ul>
        </h3>
        <aside>
          Ridiculous, but efficient. These basic types are determining how much
          memory the value you are storing will take up. What C is doing is reserving
          space for those values - and no more. For instance an int can store at
          least a 16 bit number - from âˆ’32767 to 32767. On a mac that's 2,147,483,648
          Let's see what that looks like in action.
        </aside>
      </section>
      <section>
        <pre><code class="language-c">int main() {
  int int_number;
  int_number = 2000000000;
  printf("int_number: %d\n", int_number);
  
  int_number = int_number + 2000000000;
  printf("int_number after adding: %d\n", int_number);
}
</code></pre>
        <aside>
          We'd expect 2 billion plus 2 billion to equal 4 billion - but it
          doesn't.  This effect is called integer oveflow, and it's due to the
          fact that C has run out of bits to represent the larger number in the
          space we've allocated for it. If you'd like to understand why, look up
          `two's complement` on Wikipedia.
          To save the day we need a bigger boat - I mean integer type. `long long`
          should do the trick.

        <h1>Arrays</h1>
        <aside>
          so I've not mentioned any complex data types so far - no maps, no
          sets, no FactoryFactoryProducer classes. Or even Strings. And that's
          because there aren't any - apart from arrays. And they're special too.
        </aside>
      </section>
      <section><img src="images/array.jpg">
        <aside>
          so we're familiar with this set up, the array - you have a variable, you
          access its elements with this square bracket notation, you get the nth
          element. And that's exactly what you get in C... with some small caveats.
          let's take a look at some code.
        </aside>
      </section>
      <section>
        <pre><code class="language-c">int numbers[10], i;

for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  numbers[i] = i * i;
}

for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  printf("numbers[%d]: %d\n", i, numbers[i]);
}

        <aside>
          [Explain code]
          But... what happens if we forget that arrays are zero indexed?
        </aside>
      </section>
      <section>
        <pre><code class="language-c">printf("%d\n", numbers[10]);</code></pre>
        <aside>Now what do we get?</aside>
      </section>
      <section><img src="images/array.jpg">
        <aside>
          When C assigns an array, it reserves a range of memory for it. We said
          `int[10]`, which means it will reserve 10 * the size of an int. And
          when we say `numbers[3]`, all C does is count 3 int-sized blocks of memory, and
          then give you the next int-sized block of memory.
          So when we say `numbers[10]` C just does the same
          thing, heading off into the middle distance. Sometimes we're lucky and
          we'll get something back - maybe we're reading a bit of our own code.

        <h2>Segmentation fault: 11</h2>
        <pre><code class="language-c">printf("%d\n", numbers[999999]);</code></pre>
        <aside>
          But other times the program reads so far ahead that your computer says
          "no, get off my memory - this bit is mine". And that's where we get the
          `Segmentation fault` from. And it's 11 because that's the error code for
          a segmentation fault.
          (it's 139 in the terminal because 128+x is exit value for things
          happening to you).

      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Strings</h2><img src="images/string.jpg">
        <aside>
          So all strings are are arrays of characters, terminated by a special
          character `\0`, which tells C to stop reading here. Very good. Lets
          look at this in action with another great library function, scanf()
        </aside>
      </section>
      <section>
        <pre><code class="language-c">char string[10];

scanf("%s", string);
printf("string: %d\n", number);
</code></pre>
        <aside>
          To read a string into a C program, we do something quite unintuitive
          to us: we pass a variable into a function, and tell the function what
          sort of input
        </aside>
      </section>
      <section>
        <pre><code class="language-c">int number;

scanf("%d\n", &number);
printf("number: %d\n", number);
</code></pre>
        <aside>
          But with a number, we have to do something a bit odd - we have to pass
          in the number with an & in front of it. This changes the variable from being
          an int to being a pointer to an int.
        </aside>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Pointers</h2><img src="images/pointer.png">
        <aside>
          now, all a pointer is is a type which tells C the memory location of
          another variable. So when we &'d number, we created an int pointer,
          which holds the memory location of the int 'number'
        </aside>
      </section>
      <section>
        <pre><code class="language-c">int number;
number = 55;

int *pointer_to_number;
pointer_to_number = &number;
</code></pre>
        <aside>
          but you can make a pointer yourself - you just declare the variable
          with a * in front of it. And you can go from the pointer back to the
          variable it points to by using * as well.
          Under the hood, all an array is is a pointer to a memory location,
          and when you access elements, you're incrementing that pointer to the
          next memory location

        <h1>TDD in C</h1>
        <aside>
          you can do TDD in C - there are libraries out there, but I prefer to
          use a very simple library function called assert. Let's take a look at
          that, along with some header files
