# The C Programming Language Examples

These are semi-annotated examples associated with my talk, _The C Programming
Language_. They should be approached in the following order:

1. hello-world
2. types
3. arrays
4. strings
5. tdd

most can be run using `make`

## Dependencies

To run the examples your system must have `gcc` and `make`

### Mac
`xcode-select --install`

and agree to everything

### Linux
Please look up the installation instructions for your Linux distribution's
package manager, or alternatively compile from source.

### Windows
Consider something like
[MSYS2](https://sourceforge.net/p/msys2/wiki/MSYS2%20installation/).
