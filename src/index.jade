        h1 The C Programming Language
        aside
          |Tonight I'd like to talk to you all about C, because I think that - even
          |though we may never need to use this language in production (in fact it
          |may be a terrible idea to use it in production), I think we can all learn
          |something from learning it. Learning C helped me to understand both
          |programming and my computer better.

      section
        h1 My Background
        aside So I'd like to try and give some background on why I learnt a bit of C.

      section
        img(src="images/gopher.png" width="300")
        aside
          |First up is this little fella - the Go Gopher. I've been learning Go in a
          |dedicated way for a number of months - it's great. But I noticed that
          |almost all the docs and blog posts have a sentence that starts off "In C..."
          |Go comes from C - that becomes really obvious when you see them both - and
          |it was written in many respects to make up for C's deficiencies.

      section
        img(src="images/heap-sort.gif")
        aside
          |Next up is algorithms. Denise started a Coursera course on algorithms,
          |and suggested I might like to join in. The languages they'd accept were
          |Python (just like Ruby - meh), C++ (LOOKS HARD!), Java (bleaugh) and C.
          |So I went with C. Denise said "C? Life on hard mode", and she was right.

      section
        h1 C's Background
        aside Where is C from? Well, in the early 70s Bell labs was building a new operating
          |system called Unix, on a computer called a PDP-7. Two of the guys working on it
          |were a pair of very clever people called Ken Thompson and Dennis Richie

      section
        img(src="images/thompson-richie.jpg")
        aside That's Richie on the right. The language they were using to
          |program the PDP-7 was written by Thompson for another system, but it
          |couldn't use all the advanced features of the computer. That language
          |was called B, so Richie wrote an improved B. Which he called C.
          |Because, well C comes after B. It was written to be a pretty
          |high-level language which also allowed direct access to your
          |computer's memory. Which made it great for writing operating systems.
          |And so C is _everywhere_ - literally, your computer is running in it.
          |It's in all of your computers right now. So let's get stuck in.

      section
        h1 "hello, world"
        aside Let's write a "hello, world" together

      section
        img(src="/images/c-cover.png")
        aside Fun fact: "hello, world" was popularised by this book, by Dennis Richie
          |and Brian Kernighan (also of Bell Labs and Unix). It's so influential
          |that people often refer to it and the style of writing code as "K&R"

      section
        pre
          code.language-c.
            #include #{'<stdio.h>'}

            int main() {
                printf("hello, world\n");
            }

        aside Crack open your favourite text editor and put this in. Let's save it
          |as something useful like "hello-world.c". And now let's compile it. This is
          |nice and easy. `gcc` is the Gnu Compiler Collection (formerly the Gnu C Compiler)
          |so we write `gcc hello-world.c`. This produces an executable calle `a.out`
          |So let's run that with `./a.out`. And, behold - hello world.
          |Let's break that code down a little.

      section
        pre
          code.language-c.
            #include #{'<stdio.h>'}

        aside first, the `include` thing at the top. That looks pretty weird, right?
          |All it's doing is telling the c program to bring in some function definitions
          |to the program you're writing. It's a bit like `require` in Ruby - but not
          |quite. There are some subtleties. But here we're bringing in the header file
          |`.h` - for `stdio` - functions that handle io. Like printing!

      section
        pre
          code.language-c.
            int main() {
                printf("hello, world\n");
            }

        aside Next is a function called main, which is special in C, as it is in Java
          |and Go, in that it's what gets run when the C program is executed. The `int` bit
          |tells us that it's returning an int, the parentheses are the
          |arguments - we're not using any - and then the body is in the curly
          |braces. So familiar, right?
          |And then, `printf`, which just prints to the screen the string literal that comes
          |afterwards. And we end the line with a semicolon because, well, this is C.
          |Anyone tell me why the return type is an int? And guess what the default
          |return type is for main?

      section
        h1 Types

        aside so I said the type is an int. What other types are there to play with in C?

      section
        h3
          ul
            li char
            li int
            li float
            li double
            li long
            li short
            li long long
            li long double
            li unsigned int
            li unsigned long long

        aside Ridiculous, but efficient. These basic types are determining how much
          |memory the value you are storing will take up. What C is doing is reserving
          |space for those values - and no more. For instance an int can store at
          |least a 16 bit number - from âˆ’32767 to 32767. On a mac that's 2,147,483,648
          |Let's see what that looks like in action.

      section
        pre
          code.language-c.
            int main() {
              int int_number;
              int_number = 2000000000;
              printf("int_number: %d\n", int_number);

              int_number = int_number + 2000000000;
              printf("int_number after adding: %d\n", int_number);
            }

        aside
          |We'd expect 2 billion plus 2 billion to equal 4 billion - but it
          |doesn't.  This effect is called integer oveflow, and it's due to the
          |fact that C has run out of bits to represent the larger number in the
          |space we've allocated for it. If you'd like to understand why, look up
          |`two's complement` on Wikipedia.
          |To save the day we need a bigger boat - I mean integer type. `long long`
          |should do the trick.

      section
        h1 Arrays

        aside so I've not mentioned any complex data types so far - no maps, no
          |sets, no FactoryFactoryProducer classes. Or even Strings. And that's
          |because there aren't any - apart from arrays. And they're special too.

      section
        img(src="images/array.jpg")

        aside
          |so we're familiar with this set up, the array - you have a variable, you
          |access its elements with this square bracket notation, you get the nth
          |element. And that's exactly what you get in C... with some small caveats.
          |let's take a look at some code.

      section
        pre
          code.language-c.
              int numbers[10], i;

              for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                numbers[i] = i * i;
              }

              for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                printf("numbers[%d]: %d\n", i, numbers[i]);
              }

        aside
          | [Explain code]
          | But... what happens if we forget that arrays are zero indexed?

      section
        pre
          code.language-c.
            printf("%d\n", numbers[10]);
        aside
          | Now what do we get?

      section
        img(src="images/array.jpg")
        aside
          | When C assigns an array, it reserves a range of memory for it. We said
          | `int[10]`, which means it will reserve 10 * the size of an int. And
          | when we say `numbers[3]`, all C does is count 3 int-sized blocks of memory, and
          | then give you the next int-sized block of memory.
          | So when we say `numbers[10]` C just does the same
          | thing, heading off into the middle distance. Sometimes we're lucky and
          | we'll get something back - maybe we're reading a bit of our own code.

      section
        h2 Segmentation fault: 11
        pre
          code.language-c.
            printf("%d\n", numbers[999999]);
        aside
          | But other times the program reads so far ahead that your computer says
          | "no, get off my memory - this bit is mine". And that's where we get the
          | `Segmentation fault` from. And it's 11 because that's the error code for
          | a segmentation fault.
          | (it's 139 in the terminal because 128+x is exit value for things
          | happening to you).

      section
        h2 Strings
        img(src="images/string.jpg")

        aside
          | So all strings are are arrays of characters, terminated by a special
          | character `\0`, which tells C to stop reading here. Very good. Lets
          | look at this in action with another great library function, scanf()

      section
        pre
          code.language-c.
            char string[10];

            scanf("%s", string);
            printf("string: %d\n", number);

        aside
          | To read a string into a C program, we do something quite unintuitive
          | to us: we pass a variable into a function, and tell the function what
          | sort of input

      section
        pre
          code.language-c.
            int number;

            scanf("%d\n", &number);
            printf("number: %d\n", number);

        aside
          | But with a number, we have to do something a bit odd - we have to pass
          | in the number with an & in front of it. This changes the variable from being
          | an int to being a pointer to an int.

      section
        h2 Pointers
        img(src="images/pointer.png")

        aside
          | now, all a pointer is is a type which tells C the memory location of
          | another variable. So when we &'d number, we created an int pointer,
          | which holds the memory location of the int 'number'

      section
        pre
          code.language-c.
            int number;
            number = 55;

            int *pointer_to_number;
            pointer_to_number = &number;

        aside
          | but you can make a pointer yourself - you just declare the variable
          | with a * in front of it. And you can go from the pointer back to the
          | variable it points to by using * as well.
          | Under the hood, all an array is is a pointer to a memory location,
          | and when you access elements, you're incrementing that pointer to the
          | next memory location

      section
        h1 TDD in C

        aside
          | you can do TDD in C - there are libraries out there, but I prefer to
          | use a very simple library function called assert. Let's take a look at
          | that, along with some header files
